# Project Name

Equanimity

## Description

Equanimity is a Virtual Reality simulation of a Compassion Meditation (Tonglen specifically).
- Created in 2023 for Lynda Joy Gerry's PhD at Auckland University.

Tonglen involves visualizing: 
- suffering as smoke coming into one's body on the inhale.
- desire for well-being as light on the exhale.
Breath in smoke; breathe out light.
This corresponds to the intention: Breathe in suffering; breathe out loving-kindness.

Therefore, the system uses positional data streamed from the right-hand controller of the Meta Quest 3 VR headset.
This data controls:
- Smoke particle system on forward movement (inhale, expanding the belly/diaphragm)
- Volumetric light beam on backwards movement (exhale, pulling in the belly/diaphragm)

This Biofeedbacl-driven Tonglen Visualization occurs within "Equanimity_scene_respiration_2".
